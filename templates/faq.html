                <h4><b>What are the sources included in FORENSIC?</b></h4>
<p>To date, the fecal signature of 8 sources have been investigated for both V4 and V6 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. It includes the human (sewage), dog, cow, deer and pig source-classifiers, but also the ruminant and/or the herbivore.</p>

<h4><b>What is a classifier?</b></h4>
<p>A classifier contains the information of the fecal signature structure for a given source, i.e., the sequences and their relative abundance. The classifiers were created from 15-20 samples per source using sequences assigned to Bacteroidales or Clostridiales.</p>

<h4><b>What is the difference between the universal and draft classifiers?</b></h4>
<p>We tested the specificity (i.e., ) and sensitivity (i.e., ) of each classifier using the sewage and fecal samples from multiple sources and geographic location across the world. Universal classifiers had a specificity and sensitivity higher than 70%, while draft classifiers had one of the parameter ranging from 50 to 70%. </p>

<h4><b>Why focus on Bacteroidales and Clostridiales bacterial orders?</b></h4>
<p>Bacteroidales and Clostridiales are considered to be fecal-associated bacteria. Targeting these bacterial orders reduces the "noise" caused by environmental-associated bacteria. Moreover, Bacteroidales and Clostridiales are one of the predominant bacterial group in mammals gut microbiota, their detection in environmental samples is therefore more likely. Last but not least, we consistently observe reliable patterns discriminating the different sources we investigated, reflecting the host diet, physiology, etc. of the host. </p>

<h4><b>I already processed my sequences using dada2, should I re-process everything using CUTADAPT and PEAR?</b></h4>
<p>Preliminary explorations showed that FORENSIC could not correctly identify the bacterial signatures in tested samples using data processed by dada2. This incompatibility might originate from the fact that dada2 may shorten sequences of a nucleotide during the denoising step. This is not an issue when studying the whole bacterial community, but since FORENSIC is looking for the exact sequence matches between the signatures and the sample to test, predictions can be significantly altered. </p>

<h4><b>Can I use data generated using another sequencing platform than Illumina?</b></h4>
<p>We only validated the predictions using Illumina sequence data. We would be pleased to test FORENSIC using other technologies, such as minION.</p>
               
<h4><b>FORENSIC tests automatically for multiples sources, is it possible to test samples for a specific classifier?</b></h4>
<p>The classifiers and the associated predictions are independent. The prediction of one classifier does not influence the predictions of the other classifiers.  In other words, identifying the sewage signature in a sample does not weaken the probability to detect the cow signature in that same sample.</p>

<h4><b>The source I would like to target is not in FORENSIC?</b></h4>
<p>If you have enough representative samples, we could implement this source in FORENSIC. Let's talk about it.</p>

<h4><b>How long should last an analysis?</b></h4>
<p>The analysis should take a few minutes, depending on the size of your fasta: If it takes longer than that, feel free to contact us.</p>
